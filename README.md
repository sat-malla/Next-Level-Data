Some fun website to get familiar with coding


IMPORTANT!
Review the javascript files and learn from it. Make sure you understand each line, and if you don't understand, search it up and know what it means. Check forms.html, home.html, contactme.html, and about.html for more javascript. Change file number if you make new file. Also, check data.html for putting google sheets onto HTML website.

Especially the google sheets connection to the HTML. It is really going to help a lot if you understand use it for other things you want it to use. Please remember this or at least save this repository.


If you are seeing this from a new computer, search up "Data" and change the images links for the images and the parallaxes.
